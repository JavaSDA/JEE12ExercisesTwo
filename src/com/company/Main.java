        // Write a method called averageLength. This method takes an
        // array of strings as a parameter, and returns the average length
        // of the strings in that array. Enforce that the array should have at least one element.
        // For example,
        // Input: {"hello", "world", "fish", "dog"}
        // Output: "The average length of the strings in the array is: 4.25"

        // 30 mins.
        // Write a method that accepts a String and returns the corresponding number of
        // vowel appearances in that string as an array where the first index of the array
        // is the number of A's, the second index is the number of E's and so on until the number
        // of U's. The vowel set is the english [A, E, I, O, U].
        // For example,
        // Input: "Mary had a little lamb"
        // Output: [4, 1, 1, 0, 0]
        // N.B: you can use the Arrays.toString() method to print an array as a string.

        // 30 mins. (Optional)
        // Write a program that checks an array of inputs and return returns the elements
        // that:
        // i. appear the most
        // ii. appear the least.
        // Input: {4, 2, 8, 9, 10, 10, 4, 4}
        // Output:
        // "The most occuring element is: 4, it appears 3 times.
        // "The least occuring elements are: [2, 8, 9]

        // 25 mins
        // Write a method to find the nth largest value in an integer array.
        // It takes the array and the nth value as a parameter.
        // for example: nthLargest(int[] arr, n)
        // input: {4, 28, 9, 22, 3}, 2
        // Output: "The 2 largest value is 22.


        // 25 mins
        // Write a method called reverseCase, and what it does is,
        // to reverse the case of a character in a string.
        // For example:
        // Input: Many Men have Fallen
        // Output: mANY mEN HAVE fALLEN

        // 15 mins.
        // Write a method called animals, and it takes three parameters,
        // the first one is noOfChickens, noOfCows, noOfPigs
        // chicken = 2 legs,
        // cows = 4 legs,
        // pigs = 4 legs
        // For example:
        // Input: animals(4, 2, 3)
        //Output: The total numbers of legs is: 28 legs
